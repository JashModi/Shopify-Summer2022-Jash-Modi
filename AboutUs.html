        <h1 class="name">MJ Motors Establishment</h1>
        <p class="info">
            MJ Motors started its journey in the year 1970 by Modi family. They started with a small workshop in small town of Mumbai, India. The company was firstly named Ashok Garage in early years. There were only three people working in the workshop. As the years
            passed the workshop was converted into a big factory with manpower of 800 people. <br><br> In the year 1972, there was expansion of business and a new identity given to the company as MJ Motors to all over the state of Maharashtra.
            The company currently own around 500 garages and 10 factories where various modifications take place. In August 1980, MJ Motors step forward in manufacturing motor bikes and announced it is establishing its North Indian headquarters and a
            dealership in Delhi, with the intention to offer three bikes, the Sumo 500, Classic 700 and Continental GT 535 Cafe Racer as they feel this engine size represents an underserved market. The dealership will be MJ’s first company-owned store
            in the Northern India, according to Ankush Mehta, president of MJ Motors North India. <br><br> The company wants to establish about 100 dealerships in Indian cities starting with Delhi. MJ Motors also has its name Guiness World Record of manufacturing
            most number of cars in 24 hours. Also, MJ Motors is awarded with pride gulf by honorable Home Minister of India. Later in August 1981, MJ Motors announced its entry in Indonesia as a part of its global strategy in the mid-sized motorcycle
            segment, initially starting retail operations from a dealership in Jakarta. From April to September, 1981, MJ’s domestic sales were 50% higher than the previous year, despite a declining motorcycle market in South India. In 1990, MJ Motors
            collaborated with the Richer Group, an automotive company in America, and merged with it in 1994. Apart from bikes, Richer Group is involved in the production and sales of commercial vehicles and automotive gears. Although MJ group experienced
            difficulties in the 1990s, and ceased motorcycle production at their Jaipur factory in 2002, by 2007 the company opened a new primary factory in the Chennai suburb of Oragadam on the strength of increased demand for its motorcycles.
